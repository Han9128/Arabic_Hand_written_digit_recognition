# Project Title: Arabic_Hand_written_digit_recognition
# Abstract
In recent years handwritten digit recognition has emerged as important area due to its application in several sectors. This dataset is comprised of 60000 training example and 10000 test images collected unlimited variation in human writingThis project focus on recognising the arabhic handwritten digit accurately. Various approaches are made to solve the problems and finally result came out that convolutional neural network has increased the accuracy of the model significantly.
The convolutional neural network trained on normalized dataset with the appropriate learning rate chosen has increased the accuracy of the model upto 99.08% with loss 0.065 on test set.
# Dataset:
